# Privacy Policy for Wingmantra
**Effective Date:** September 3, 2025

**Wingmantra** (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is a mental health and stress-management tool designed for pilots. We care deeply about your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data—or, in this case, **don’t** handle it.

## 1. No Data Collection
Wingmantra does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal information, personal identifiers, health data, usage analytics, diagnostics, or any other user data under any circumstances.

## 2. On-Device Only
All features operate **on your device**. If you enter information or grant system permissions (e.g., Apple Health/HealthKit or notifications), any data that might be displayed or processed remains solely on your device and is **never** sent to us or our servers. We do not operate servers for Wingmantra.

> Note: If you revoke related system permissions, the app may limit or disable features that rely on those permissions, but Wingmantra still does not collect data.

## 3. No Third-Party Sharing
We do not share any data with third parties, advertisers, analytics providers, or data brokers—because we do not collect any data.

## 4. No Cookies or Trackers
Wingmantra does not use cookies, SDKs, analytics tools, or any tracking technologies.

## 5. Security
Because we do not collect or store any data, risks related to breaches or unauthorized access to our systems are inherently minimized. Any information you keep on your device is protected by your device’s security and your platform’s controls (e.g., iOS passcode/biometrics).

## 6. Children’s Privacy
Wingmantra does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13. If this ever changes, we will update this policy and comply with applicable laws.

## 7. Policy Changes
If our practices change (for example, if we decide to collect limited data to improve the app), we will update this Privacy Policy and provide clear notice **before** any change takes effect.
